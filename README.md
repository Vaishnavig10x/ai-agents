**AI-Agents Project**

**Overview**

The AI-Agents project aims to accommodate different AI agents performing various tasks to automate organizational activities. This project focuses on standardizing the AI agent code and creating a front-end interface to access multiple AI agents.

**Project Structure**

Backend: FastAPI

Frontend: React.js

Database: No database currently in use, but PostgreSQL or MongoDB may be included in the future.

APIs: Commonly used APIs include GPT and Deepgram.

Containerization: The project will be containerized to ensure easy deployment and scalability.

Queuing Services: Considering the need to handle concurrent access by hundreds of users, queuing services like Kafka or RabbitMQ may be integrated.

**Features**

1. Standardized AI agent codebase.
2. Front-end interface to access multiple AI agents.
3. Scalable architecture to handle concurrent users.
4. Potential integration with PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
5. Use of GPT and Deepgram APIs for various AI tasks.
6. Containerized deployment for easy scalability.
7. Queuing services for efficient task management.
